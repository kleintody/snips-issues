# Snips Issues

Please fill here the issues you encountered using Snips Flow.

If you are looking for **support**, use the [forum](https://forum.snips.ai). It will be easier to share your experience and the solution to your problem with the community 

Before creating a new issue, check if it has not already been reported.

Consider reporting the following information to ease the debugging:
- Which platform you are using (e.g. Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi3)
- What is the version of your platform (e.g. Snips Flow 1.1.0 (0.61.2))
- Did you install the platform manually or are you only using sam
- Logs from `snips-watch -v`, `journalctl -u snips-*`, `/var/log/syslog`
- If you already found the service that is failing, you can stop the service `sudo systemctl stop <service>` and restart it manually and increase verbosity with `-v` to provide more logs.

Thanks again for your feedbacks!
